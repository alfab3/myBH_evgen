\chapter{Manual Changes}
\section{FORTRAN without C++ counterparts}
\begin{outline}
    \1 FORTRAN functions have result set equal to the declaration term this is not caught by the translator
        \2Fixed by setting return to a new variable
        \2Functions that needed repair:
            \3Brem
            \3xcstn
    \1 Arrays start at 1 in FORTRAN this was not corrected by translator
        \2Fixed by manually setting arrays to one position lower
    \1 Certain math functions don't translate properly and have to be rewritten. Examples:
        \2dacos - acos
        \2dlog - log
        \2datan - atan
        \2dsqrt - sqrt
        \2Dcos - cos
        \2Dsin - sin
    \1 Small issues
        \2 A lot of lines needed ";" appended at the end
        \2 Some comments needed restructuring
        \2 Fortran is not case sensitive
        \2 No save statement in C++
        \2 Numbers have "D6, D7, D8" at the end
        \2 .not. turns to !

\chapter{Issues}
\section{FORTRAN Issues}
The following issues have to be resolved in order to make the program work in C++
\begin{itemize}
    \item printf functionality, specifically unit number
    \item fopen declaration
    \item snaf functionality
    \item Function "analysis" has type declaration issues
    
\end{itemize}
